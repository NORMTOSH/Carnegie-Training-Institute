# LINEAR REGRESSION
Linear Regression: In statistics and machine learning, Linear Regression (LR) is a statistical model used to understand the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. 
It assumes a linear relationship between the variables and tries to fit a line that best represents the data.
The goal is to find the best-fitting linear equation that describes the relationship between the variables.

In simple linear regression, there is only one independent variable, and the relationship is represented by a straight line. The equation takes the form:

y = b0 + b1*x

where y is the dependent variable, x is the independent variable, b0 is the intercept (the value of y when x is 0), and b1 is the slope (the change in y for a unit change in x).

Multiple linear regression extends this concept to include multiple independent variables:

y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + ... + bn*xn

where x1, x2, ..., xn are the independent variables, and b1, b2, ..., bn are the coefficients representing the effect of each independent variable on the dependent variable.

The linear regression model estimates the values of the coefficients (b0, b1, ..., bn) based on the given data, using a technique such as least squares, to minimize the difference between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable. This allows us to make predictions or understand the relationship between variables based on the estimated coefficients.

Linear regression is a foundational technique in statistical modeling and machine learning and is used in various fields for prediction, forecasting, and understanding relationships between variables.
